 Cheat guide :
 -
 Level 0 : <br />
 Jump down to the lower field. <br />
 Jump up and pass the first checkpoint. <br />
 Switch directions. <br />
 Double jump carefully to attain the first platform. <br />
 Double jump onto the cliff face.  <br />
 Pass the second checkpoint. <br />
 Activate the lever and advance onto the platform.  <br />
 Conserve lateral momentum to stay on the platform and collect the coin.  <br />
 Jump onto the mud slope and pedal upwards.  <br />
 Congratulations ! You've successfully cheated on the tutorial level.  <br />
 <br /> <br />
 Level 1 (This is where the fun begins :-)) : <br />
 Beware of the ice as it has less traction than regular terrain. <br />
 Jump onto the platform as the pendulum is swinging back at you, narrowly missing you. <br />
 Land onto the platform and jump as fast as possible to the other bank of the lava pool. <br />
 Choose whether to risk collecting the coins. <br />
 As fast as possible advance without being killed by the mines. (They are specifically timed to miss you if you are
  going as fast as possible.) <br />
 Attain the next checkpoint and activate the lever.  <br />
 Get onto the platform and ride it toward the cave entrance. <br />
 Cautiously enter the cave, as a gravity well will try and accelerate you forward.  <br />
 Brake somewhat and before the drop switch directions and tilt forward.  <br />
 Brake hard right before the checkpoint to stop.  <br />
 Whether or not you've managed to stop, you have to go the perfect speed, switch and tilt forward so that the 
 back wheel rests against the wall, then switch and brace against the forward wall to offset yourself in 
 the other direction. You shouldn't die because of this, but going too fast will definitely kill you ! <br />
 Once you've attained the bottom, activate the lever and wait that the lasers cycle once. <br />
 Then advance cautiously between the first two rows of lasers. Wait one more cycle. <br />
 Accelerate and time your jump over the acid pool to align with the coins, then brake as hard as possible
 while landing.  <br />
 Wait until the laser cycle finishes, then rush toward the lever, which will deactivate the lasers and open the door.  <br />
 Activate the next lever and stand upon the platform.  <br />
 At the top, cycle onto the flat area. You can then safely progress to the finish point on the right.  <br />
 For an added challenge and score bonus, you can go left onto the platform, and activate the lever.  <br />
 This will trigger the fall of 3 explosive barrels so quickly retreat to where the platform previously dropped you off. <br />
 Once the barrels have fallen, use your shotgun to destroy the one barrel remaining on the platform where the lever<br />
 was located.<br />
 A short time after the barrels have fallen, a gate will open, allowing you to collect 600 points worth of coins !<br />
 You can now proceed to the finish point and complete the first level.
 
 <br /> <br />
 Level 2 (Boss Battle) :
 You spawn onto a slope. You have to follow the slope onto a rocky segment where the path downward is blocked. <br />
 You have to traverse the rocky segment by being careful as to where you go, as a plane is dropping bombs from the sky on this segment.<br />
 Then you have to jump down onto a platform, then switch sides then jump down onto the next platform.<br />
 From there you can attain the next checkpoint.<br />
 Activate the lever and get onto the platform.<br />
 Whilst going up you can kill the plane with your weapon.<br />
 You can then get onto the ledge and activate the next checkpoint.<br />
 The next part is tricky : Once you activate the lever to open the door, lasers will start oscillating, which means certain death on contact.<br />
 Halfway up you can choose to acquire the bonus coins but the jump is tricky.<br />
 At the top of this vertical shaft another lever opens the last door and deactivates the lasers.<br />
 You then have to rush through a carpet-bombed area and jump over a lava pool to attain the other side.<br />
 Once you enter the tunnel you are safe and can progress towards the final checkpoint.<br />
